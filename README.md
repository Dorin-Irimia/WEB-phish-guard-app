# phish-guard-app

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines Next.js, Self, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **Next.js** - Full-stack React framework
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **shadcn/ui** - Reusable UI components
- **Prisma** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with Prisma.

1. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/web/.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection details.

3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

## Cloudinary Setup (for file uploads)

This project uses Cloudinary for storing user avatars and scan images.

1. Sign up for a free account at [https://cloudinary.com/](https://cloudinary.com/)
2. Go to your Cloudinary Dashboard at [https://console.cloudinary.com/](https://console.cloudinary.com/)
3. Copy your Cloud Name, API Key, and API Secret
4. Create a `.env.local` file in `apps/web/` (or copy from `.env.local.example`)
5. Add your Cloudinary credentials:

```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

The free tier includes:
- 25 GB storage
- 25 GB monthly bandwidth
- Perfect for development and small production apps

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the fullstack application.
